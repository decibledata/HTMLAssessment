	<h1>MLB WORLD SERIES</h1>
		<hr>

<!Paragraphs>

		<p>
			<b>The</b> 120th Major League Baseball World Series concluded on Wednesday Oct. 30 with an impressive win for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Facing off against the New York Yankees, the Dodgers secured a commanding victory as the series concluded 4-1. The Dodgers dominated the first three games, winning the first  6-3 and the second and third 4-2. The Yankees bounced back in game four with a decisive 11-4 win, however, the Dodgers denied any real attempt for a comeback during an extremely tight game five, clinching the series with a score of 7-6.<br>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<b>The</b> Los Angeles Dodgers are World Series champions again after staging a stellar come-from-behind victory against their historically bitter rivals, the New York Yankees.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
					<b>In</b> a true team effort, the Dodgers won their title with scrappy determination as they became the first team in a World Series clinching game to come back from a deficit of five or more runs. The Dodgers bullpen also broke records – eight pitchers led from the mound in game five, which was the most that have ever appeared for one team in a series win. Los Angeles proved themselves a deeper team, winning in the margins thanks in part to critical errors made by the humbled Yankees. The game ironically ended with "New York, New York,” by Frank Sinatra playing on the speakers in Yankee stadium as the Dodgers descended on the mound celebrating.
